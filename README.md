# RFID
Final Project for Advanced Programming Applications

This code is meant to test the Python programming skills involved with creating a program to be run on a Raspberry Pi which communicated with a RFID read and write module called the RC522.
The module is connected through GPIO and the main purpose is to see if three occupations (Medic, Police Officer, and Airport Security) can only see information pertinent to their fields when the RFID is scanned.
The Medic should only be able to see information necessary for them to see nothing like an address or safe driver status, etc.
The Police Officer should only be able to see information that is on your license.
The Airport Security should only be able to see information that they would need to verify when travelling.

All in all, this experience was full of frustration whenver things would not work correctly and excitement when learning and piecing things together as well as getting things to work in the end.

This program was to see if it was possible to replace licenses, passports, and medical cards with one all-purpose RFID card as well with the logic on how to achieve that. In the future, it could also potentially include payment, house door key, car key and more.
